# NodeBB Buzzer plugin

This is an annoying little NodeBB plugin. It adds a 'Buzz' button to the chat modal. Once clicked, the other user will have their modal shaken and a nostalgic little annoying sound played!

For the sake of sanity this has some form of rate limiting and you can only buzz people if you both have your chat modal open.

## Installation

    npm install nodebb-plugin-buzzer
